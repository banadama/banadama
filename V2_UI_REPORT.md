# Banadama V2 UI/UX Implemention Report

The Banadama platform has been upgraded to the **Version 2** design system, focusing on a premium B2B ecommerce aesthetic.

## 🎨 Key Design Shifts
- **Liquid Glass**: Translucent containers with background blur (`backdrop-blur-md`), subtle borders, and soft shadows.
- **Orange Glow**: Primary accent color switched to high-vibe Orange (`#f97316`) with glowing effects for active states and primary CTAs.
- **SVG Iconography**: Replaced all emojis and generic icon strings with a unified SVG icon system (`@/components/icons/icons`).
- **Typography & Spacing**: Refined hierarchy for better readability on desktop and mobile.

## 🚀 Architectural Changes
- **Subdomain Routing**: Implemented `middleware.ts` for host-based rewrites.
  - `banadama.com` -> Buyer focus.
  - `supplier.banadama.com` -> Supplier onboarding & dashboard.
- **Role Isolation**: Moved role-selection onboarding out of the common buyer registration flow into the dedicated supplier flow.

## 📂 Files Impacted
| Area | Files | Changes |
|---|---|---|
| **Core UI** | `globals.css`, `components/ui/*` | Tokenized variables, new Button/Card/Badge styles. |
| **Icons** | `components/icons/icons.tsx` | Added 20+ custom SVG icons. |
| **Landing** | `app/page.tsx`, `components/sections/*` | Complete Liquid Glass overhaul. |
| **Marketplace** | `app/marketplace/*` | Polished product cards, filters, and infinite grid. |
| **Cart/Checkout** | `app/(buyer)/buyer/cart/*`, `app/(buyer)/buyer/checkout/*` | Modernized checkout flow with glass info blocks. |
| **Verification** | `components/verification/VerificationBadge.tsx` | New Blue/Green/Gold SVG tick system. |

## 🛠 Fixes & Polishing
- **Build Stabilization**: Fixed static collection failure in `/api/admin/accounts/[id]/controls`.
- **Typing**: Added proper generic types to `apiPost` and `apiGet` calls to resolve TypeScript lint errors.
- **Toast Integration**: Replaced legacy `window.alert` with the new V2 Toast system.
